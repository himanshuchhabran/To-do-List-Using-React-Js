//virtual dom -> ab use nhi hota hai
//react fiber is implementation of react's core algorithm

//har bar ui update karne se acha kuch time pause karne ke baad update karna 
//ability to give priority to updates

//reconcillation - it checks difference b/w one tree with another to determine which parts
//  need to changed

//fiber ki algorithm me performance improve karne ke liye keys ka use hota hai
//keys help react identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed

//react me har component ek fiber node hota hai
//fiber node me information hoti hai about component type, its props, state, and more

//react fiber architecture me rendering process ko chote chunks me tod diya jata hai
//isse react ko time milta hai high-priority updates ko handle karne ka

//concurrent mode - is mode me react multiple tasks ko ek sath handle kar sakta hai
//isse user experience improve hota hai kyunki app zyada responsive lagta hai

//react fiber ki wajah se react me animation, gestures, and other high-priority updates smoothly handle hote hain

//overall, react fiber ne react ki performance aur responsiveness ko kaafi improve kiya hai, especially for complex applications
