//What is closures?

//Closures is automatic phenomenon which happens when we create a function it is not that create manually by using any keyword.

//It allows inner function to remember and access  variables from outer function even after executing outer function.

//What is callback function?

//A callback function is a function which is passed as an argument to another function.

//It is used in asynchronus tasks.

//But multiples callbacks creates callback hell so 

//TO we use promise and async/await.


//Window - global obj hota hai

//DOM - html page ka javascript object ban jata jai or document name ho jata h uska

//BOM - addtional object provided by the browser.

//To redirect to any location
